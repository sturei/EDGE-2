## Prequisites

Ensure you have the prerequisites as described in the README in the root folder of the project.


## Build and test the viewer

```
% cd web/e2_viewer
% npm install
% npm run dev
% open a browser window at the url suggested
```

# In case you need to create another vite app
```
% cd <PROJECT_ROOT_DIR>/web

And then figure out how to share code between your new app and the existing app !
